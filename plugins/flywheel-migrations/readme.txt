== FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ==

=Can I still use this plugin if I don’t have a Flywheel account?=
You need a Flywheel account to use the plugin, but it’s easy and free to create one! [Create an account here](https://app.getflywheel.com/signup).

=What information will the plugin ask for?=
All we need is your email address and a few site details, including the Flywheel dashboard URL, temporary URL, and privacy mode credentials. Check out this [migration help doc](https://getflywheel.com/wordpress-support/migrating-your-site-from-another-host-to-flywheel/) for guidance!

=Why do you need my email?=
We require an email address to send you updates on the migration process, notify you of any errors that occur during the migration.

=Is Multisite Network supported with this plugin?=
Yes, this plugin is capable of moving full Multisite Networks! To move a full network, make sure to install and activate the Flywheel Migrations plugin in the Network Admin of the multisite you would like to migrate.

=Can I migrate a site into or out of a Multisite Network using this plugin?=
No, this plugin is designed to migrate one complete WordPress install. It does not support single WordPress installs being migrated into Multisite Networks or subsites out of a multisite.

=How long does it take to migrate a website?=
Sites come in all shapes and sizes. Because of this, migrations can range anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours.

=What happens if I run into an error after the migration is complete?=
We always recommend clicking through your site for quality assurance. No matter what, we’re here to help! Whether it be a failed migration or you find something amiss while looking over your site, reach out to our [technical onboarding team](https://app.getflywheel.com/tickets/new?source=blogvault) or [fill out a migration request](https://app.getflywheel.com/migration) to have our team take it from there.

=Other than running the plugin, is there anything else I need to do?=
Once the migration completes, you will still need to [take your site live](https://getflywheel.com/wordpress-support/go-live-flywheel/) by updating your DNS to point to our servers. If you have any custom configurations on your current server, our [support team](https://getflywheel.com/wordpress-support/how-do-i-get-help/) can assist you in setting those up on your Flywheel server.

=Do I need to leave the window open while the migration is processing?=
Nope! Sit back and relax while robots move your site. Once your migration is complete, we’ll send a completion email to your inbox.

=Do you exclude any plugins during the migration?=
The plugin does exclude most common backup, caching, security, and performance plugins during the migration. This is to eliminate conflicts or redundancy with Flywheel features! That said, we do not ban any plugins from being installed. You are always welcome to reinstall any excluded plugins, but bear in mind performance may be impacted.
